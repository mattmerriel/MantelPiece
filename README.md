Technical Lead: Matthew Merriel <matt.merriel@mantelgroup.com.au>

# What it does
MantelPiece is a terminal based application designed to reside on a consultants local machine. Once installed, it can be used to automate the process of conducting repediative, time consuming tasks such as running scripts against dozens/100's of AWS Accounts.... to streamlining the process of calucalting pricing data

# How it works
MantelPiece can be broken down into three main parts:
1. **The Console App:** This is the part of the application that the consultant interacts with and simply provided a mechanism to insert/extract various piexes of data (Account Lists, pricing details, Customer documentation such as rvtools etc). Given it's internal, non critical status... to gdate, not a lot of time/effort has been spent on this part of the applicaiton.
